### Notes:

- **TRL-3:** **Simulation-only stage**. No real hardware dependencies. Validates functionality of CPU, peripherals, memory, and firmware logic in Renode.  
- **TRL-4:** **First hardware runtime validation**. Uses real MCXN974 board to verify basic boot, firmware loading, and peripheral functionality.  
- **TRL-5 → TRL-7:** Gradually increase system integration, stress, and pre-flight qualification.
